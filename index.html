     <h2>My Resume</h2>

      <h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
      <ul>
       <div class="intro">
        <li>1. CCNA completion with an average pass score of over 80 precent.  Technology has always fascinated me. How it works and especially how it is evolved. After completing my general school studies I wanted to develop my technical skills. Cisco Certified Network Associate was my first option. I wanted to understand how a network works thus taking up CCNA. So far it is been a very educative experience that has opened my eyes to many possibilities. I will be extending my knowledge by completing CCNP in the future.</li>

        <li>Charity work. As a scout member I was humbled to help raise money for charity. It was an experience that helped me realize that the smallest things could help someone somewhere greatly. I was humbled by the whole experience.</li>

        <li>Selling my own artwork. I made designs for letters and cards and was very successful, selling in excess of 150 pieces. This experience led me to taking up a course in Animation which helped my zeal for art grow through photography and camera lighting.</li>

        <li>Volley ball team Vice Captain. This is a sport I became passionate about. I joined the team and was later elected the vice-captain of our team following my commitment to the team and my improving ability in the sport.</li>

        <li>Performing Arts.  Being on stage has always given me great joy. At school I joined the drama club. Our club grew immensely when we started performing for public audiences. I was elected the vice-captain; as a result I gained leading roles in traditional based plays like The River between by Ngugi Wa Thiongo.</li>

       </ul>

      <h2>CAREER OBJECTIVES</h2>
       <p>Currently I am self teaching in code and programming through a website called code academy. The growth in technology has made this possible. It has been intense especially since its a new subject for me but I am enjoying every step. After completing the programming course, I intend to pursue a course in Ethical Hacking. The chance to play a part in the growth of our country by assuring confidentiality to various companies and also in exposing various threats that are bringing our country to the ground is a key driver for me. Kenya is not in full disposal of the best in information technology. It would be an honor if I could be one of the young people to stand out.</p>

 <h3>SKILLS</h3>
<p>Technology, through most of my studies, technology has played a huge part. I have become more acquainted with it and it’s safe to say I know my way around a computer. It is more like deciphering a puzzle and still it is an art in itself.</p>
<p>3D animation,  After high school I decided to expound on my passion for art. I took a course in 3D animation.  Video editing and script writing are some of the other benefits I derived from pursuing 3D Animation.</p>
<p>Creative Arts, from grade 7 I developed a passion in art. I tutored myself by trying new projects and pushing my skills to the limit. By the time I was in high school, I was able to sell some of my artwork by designing cards and letters.</p>
<p>Camera and Lighting, it is one of my favorite abilities. To me photos are art in their own right, they capture the best part of an image or a person. I enjoyed the projects I got to do while learning the ways around it. It’s something I plan on pursuing.</p>

<h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
<p>After high school I worked as a waitress at “Nimo’s tasty food” café. It was a good experience, my key responsibility was to make sure the customers experience was a positive by keenly taking their order, delivering orders in time and handling the payment transaction swiftly. While pursuing my studies in networking. I was offered an internship job in copycat limited. I gained lots of experience working in the field with the company’s engineers. I got to have a feel of what being an engineer is all about. I got to help work on projects from established companies like, the United Nations and Aljazeera. It is an experience I will never forget.</p>
